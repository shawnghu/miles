# Fault Tolerance E2E Tests

## Overview Table

### CI Entries

- **CI entry files**: `test_<TEST_NAME>__<mode>.py`, or `test_<TEST_NAME>__<kill>.py` when the scenario pins its own topology and takes no mode; split on the first `__` to read the scenario and the rest back out, which is why no scenario name contains one.
- **The segment after the scenario is always the kill segment**: a mode name starts with it, and an entry with no mode carries it alone, so every entry says what its run crashes without anyone opening the file.
- **Entry file content**: `register_cuda_ci(est_time=..., suite=..., labels=[...], hardware=[...])` plus `run_ci(_MODE)` under `__main__`, no test logic.
- **Execution model**: bare `python3 <file>` from the repo root, exit code = pass/fail (`tests/ci/ci_utils.py` `run_unittest_files`).

| Scenario | Modes with an entry file |
| --- | --- |
| `scenario_trainer_no_failure` | `kill_train__dp2_cp2_tp2_ep2__fake_rollout__moe_5layer`, `kill_train__dp2_cp2_pp2__fake_rollout__moe_5layer`, `kill_train__dp4_cp2__fake_rollout__moe_5layer`, `kill_train__dp2_cp2__moe_5layer` |
| `scenario_trainer_deterministic` | `kill_train__dp2_cp2_tp2_ep2__fake_rollout__moe_5layer`, `kill_train__dp2_cp2_pp2__fake_rollout__moe_5layer`, `kill_train__dp4_cp2__fake_rollout__moe_5layer`, `kill_train__dp2_cp2__moe_5layer` |
| `scenario_trainer_with_failure` | `kill_train__dp2_cp2_tp2_ep2__fake_rollout__moe_5layer`, `kill_train__dp2_cp2_pp2__fake_rollout__moe_5layer`, `kill_train__dp4_cp2__fake_rollout__moe_5layer`, `kill_train__dp2_cp2` |
| `scenario_rollout_deterministic` | `kill_rollout__dp4` |
| `scenario_trainer_all_gather_fault` | `kill_train__dp2_tp2` |
| `scenario_p2p_send_receiver_fault` | `kill_rollout__dp2_tp2` |
| `scenario_inference_scaling` | `test_inference_scaling__kill_rollout.py`, no modes |
| `scenario_trainer_scaling` | `test_trainer_scaling__kill_train.py`, no modes |
| `scenario_random_crash` | `kill_train__dp2_cp2_tp2_ep2__fake_rollout__moe_5layer`, `kill_train__dp2_cp2__moe_5layer`, `kill_train_rollout__dp2_cp2`, `kill_rollout__dp4` |
| `scenario_realistic_gsm8k` | `test_realistic_gsm8k__kill_train_rollout.py`, no modes |
| `scenario_random_crash_fully_async` | `kill_train_rollout__dp2_cp2` |
| `scenario_realistic_gsm8k_fully_async` | `test_realistic_gsm8k_fully_async__kill_train_rollout.py`, no modes |

- **Forced absences**, one reason each:
    - `kill_train__dp4_cp2_tp2_pp2_ep2_etp2__moe_full` is multi-node, and no multi-node CI lane exists.
    - `kill_rollout__dp4` fits only the scenarios that crash engines.
    - `scenario_rollout_deterministic` needs real engines and `ft_components == ("rollout",)` exactly.
    - The fully-async soaks reject modes without real engines.
    - `kill_train__dp2_cp2` supersedes `kill_train__dp2_cp2__moe_5layer` in `scenario_trainer_with_failure`.
- **Every other absence is an unclaimed cell**, not a decision — adding an entry file is all it takes.

### Scenarios

- **Scenario logic**: `conftest_ft/scenario_<name>.py` — a typer app plus a `run_ci(mode)` runner.

| Scenario (`conftest_ft/scenario_*.py`) | Type | What it verifies |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `scenario_trainer_no_failure` | comparison | indep_dp matches normal DP when no faults |
| `scenario_trainer_with_failure` | comparison, multi-phase | indep_dp matches normal DP after fault + ckpt resume |
| `scenario_trainer_deterministic` | comparison, multi-phase | healing state transfer is bitwise-correct, on cold start and on resume from a post-healing ckpt |
| `scenario_rollout_deterministic` | comparison | engine crashes change training bits not at all |
| `scenario_trainer_all_gather_fault` | comparison | a trainer rank killed, stopped or deadlocked in the weight-update all-gather changes training bits not at all |
| `scenario_p2p_send_receiver_fault` | comparison | an engine killed while the trainer is sending it weights over P2P changes training bits not at all |
| `scenario_inference_scaling` | soak | the engine pool grows and shrinks under a live run, and the run follows it |
| `scenario_trainer_scaling` | soak | the trainer pool gains and loses a DP cell under a live run, and the quorum follows it |
| `scenario_random_crash` | soak | system survives random crashes without hanging |
| `scenario_realistic_gsm8k` | soak | model still reaches gsm8k accuracy under random crashes |
| `scenario_random_crash_fully_async` | soak | same, through `train_async.py --fully-async` |
| `scenario_realistic_gsm8k_fully_async` | soak | same, through `train_async.py --fully-async` |

### Modes

- **Selection**: `--mode`, defined in `conftest_ft/modes.py`; `scenario_realistic_gsm8k` takes none.
- **Mode names**: `<kill>__<parallelism>[__fake_rollout][__moe_5layer|__moe_full]`, segments separated by `__` and joined by `_` inside a segment.
- **What a name carries**: the `kill` segment always, then only the axes that differ from the naming defaults — real sglang engines, the dense `Qwen3-0.6B`. Node counts, engine counts and cell counts are never in the name; read them from the table below.
- **Why `kill` leads**: what a run crashes is the subject of this suite, so it is the first thing the name answers, and it is a property of the mode alone — no scenario widens it at runtime.
- **The scheme is enforced, not remembered**: `compute_mode_name` derives a mode's name from its fields against an explicit naming-default table, and `tests/fast/e2e/ft/test_naming_scheme.py` fails when a name drifts from it.
- **Declared per mode**: cell count, parallelism, model, train/rollout GPU split, `ft_components` (default `("train",)`). Every mode is disaggregated: training and rollout hold gpus of their own.
- **No rollout engines**: modes with `rollout_num_engines == 0` train on pre-recorded debug rollout data.

| Mode | Nodes | GPUs (train + rollout) | DP cells | Parallelism | Rollout | Model | `ft_components` | Why it exists |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `kill_train__dp2_cp2_tp2_ep2__fake_rollout__moe_5layer` | 1 | 8 + 0 | 2 | CP2 TP2 EP2 | debug data | 5-layer MoE | `("train",)` | TP + EP coverage |
| `kill_train__dp2_cp2_pp2__fake_rollout__moe_5layer` | 1 | 8 + 0 | 2 | CP2 PP2 | debug data | 5-layer MoE | `("train",)` | PP coverage, via `--decoder-first-pipeline-num-layers 3 --decoder-last-pipeline-num-layers 2` |
| `kill_train__dp4_cp2__fake_rollout__moe_5layer` | 1 | 8 + 0 | 4 | CP2 | debug data | 5-layer MoE | `("train",)` | multi-replica coverage (>= 4 cells); uneven split after a fault |
| `kill_train__dp2_cp2__moe_5layer` | 1 | 4 + 4 | 2 | CP2 | 4 engines × 1 GPU | 5-layer MoE | `("train",)` | real engines + the weight-update path |
| `kill_train__dp2_cp2` | 1 | 4 + 4 | 2 | CP2 | 4 engines × 1 GPU | dense Qwen3-0.6B | `("train",)` | `scenario_trainer_with_failure` under real generation; needs the dense model (see below) |
| `kill_rollout__dp4` | 1 | 4 + 4 | 4 | — | 4 engines × 1 GPU, disaggregated | dense Qwen3-0.6B | `("rollout",)` | the only rollout-only mode: crashes engines, not trainer cells |
| `kill_train_rollout__dp2_cp2` | 1 | 4 + 4 | 2 | CP2 | 4 engines × 1 GPU | dense Qwen3-0.6B | `("train", "rollout")` | both kinds crash in the same run, sync and fully-async |
| `kill_train__dp2_tp2` | 1 | 4 + 4 | 2 | TP2 | 4 engines × 1 GPU | dense Qwen3-0.6B | `("train",)` | trainer faults inside the weight-update tensor all-gather |
| `kill_rollout__dp2_tp2` | 1 | 4 + 4 | 2 | TP2 | 4 engines × 1 GPU | dense Qwen3-0.6B | `("rollout",)` | a receiving engine killed during the trainer's P2P send |
| `kill_train__dp4_cp2_tp2_pp2_ep2_etp2__moe_full` | 4 train + 2 rollout | 32 + 16 | 4 | CP2 TP2 PP2 EP2 ETP2 | 2 engines × 8 GPU | full MoE | `("train",)` | full model, all parallelism; multi-node, so no CI entry |

- **Batch shape**: `--rollout-batch-size 32 --n-samples-per-prompt 8 --global-batch-size 256` everywhere — 256 samples per rollout, divisible by both 2 and 4 cells. `scenario_trainer_with_failure` x `kill_train__dp4_cp2__fake_rollout__moe_5layer` trains the fault rollout on the 3 surviving cells, so the uneven 256-over-3 split is exercised there.
- **Model**: 1-node modes use the 5-layer MoE `Qwen3-30B-A3B-5layer`, except the five dense modes.

## Running the code

### In CI

- **Gating labels**: `run-ci-ft-short` for the comparison scenarios (minutes each), `run-ci-ft-long` for the soaks (tens of minutes to hours). Nothing here runs on an unlabelled PR.
- **Broad scopes**: `run-ci-all` includes both; the nightly cadence includes `ft-short` but not `ft-long`; `run-ci-image` excludes both.
- **Suite**: `suite="stage-c-8-gpu-h200"`, run by the job of the same name in `.github/workflows/pr-test.yml`.
- **Hardware**: every entry declares `hardware=["hopper", "blackwell"]`.
- **Enabled ft-long entries**: `run-ci-ft-long` runs the sync and fully-async `random_crash` entries in mode `kill_train_rollout__dp2_cp2`. Other ft-long entries remain disabled; `tests/ci/run_suite.py` skips every test with a non-`None` `disabled`.
- **Disabled reasons**: remaining disabled FT entries use `FT soak tests pending CI infra support` or `will enable in future FT delivery`; `tests/e2e/deploy/test_hot_restart_realistic_gsm8k.py` starts with `needs a Kubernetes cluster backend`.
- **Add a `(scenario, mode)`**: copy an entry file, change `_MODE`.
- **Add a label**: an entry in `tests/ci/labels.py` plus the matching `run-ci-<key>` GitHub label; the workflow needs no edit.

### Manually

`PYTHONPATH` must point at the repo root (CI sets it automatically).

```bash
# One mode, exactly as CI runs it
PYTHONPATH=. python tests/e2e/ft/test_trainer_no_failure__kill_train__dp2_cp2_tp2_ep2__fake_rollout__moe_5layer.py

# Any mode, including the ones with no entry file
PYTHONPATH=. python tests/e2e/ft/conftest_ft/scenario_trainer_no_failure.py run --mode kill_train__dp4_cp2__fake_rollout__moe_5layer
```

| Subcommand | Does | Available in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `run` | full pipeline: prepare + every phase's baseline/target + compare | all scenarios |
| `baseline` / `target` | one side only, for debugging | comparison scenarios |
| `compare` | re-run the comparison on existing dumps (no GPU) | comparison scenarios |
| `generate-data` | record debug rollout data with real engines, no dumper | comparison scenarios |

- **Debugging**: prefer the individual subcommands over `run` — with a shared `--dump-dir` (plus `--phase` when multi-phase) you re-run only what changed.
- **`scenario_rollout_deterministic`**: the comparison subcommands, with the injection constants fixed in the module rather than exposed as options.
- **`scenario_random_crash`**: only `run`, with `--mode` / `--seed` / `--num-steps` / `--trainer-crash-interval-seconds` / `--rollout-crash-interval-seconds` / `--fully-async`.
- **`scenario_realistic_gsm8k`**: only `run`, with `--seed` / `--num-rollout` / `--trainer-crash-interval-seconds` / `--rollout-crash-interval-seconds` / `--metric-threshold` / `--fully-async`; no `--mode`.
- **`scenario_*_fully_async`**: only `run`, with the same options minus `--fully-async`, which they pin.
- **Dumps**: `resolve_dump_dir` in `tests/utils/soak/core/utils.py` puts them under `$MILES_TEST_DUMPS_ROOT/<run_id>/<test_name>/`, falling back to `/node_public/dumps` when the cluster sets no root. A comparison scenario's `run` deletes them when it ends; the soak scenarios refuse a nonempty dump directory and never delete it. The run id is what stops two agents running the same test from deleting each other's dumps.

### Cluster Backend

- **Selection**: `command_utils.default_config()`, off `MILES_SCRIPT_CLUSTER_BACKEND` / `MILES_SCRIPT_NAMESPACE` / `MILES_SCRIPT_RUN_ID`, already set in the miles-workbench pod.
- **Scenarios stay backend-agnostic**: no mode declares one; the backend changes only the set of fault forms.
- **One config throughout**: the same `ExecuteTrainConfig` threads through `prepare()`, `run_training()` and `api_server_host()`; on kubernetes the api server lives on a pod named after its `run_id`, so a second config would aim the injector at a release that does not exist.
- **Side-specific releases**: a comparison may provide `config_for_side`; the pipeline applies it once before the target context and launch, which both receive that same transformed config.
- **Bounded side handoff**: after each kubernetes comparison side, including a failed one, the pipeline uninstalls its Helm release and waits at most five minutes for both the release and every release-labelled pod to disappear. The next side and the CPU comparison start only after that completes, so asynchronous chart cleanup cannot overlap their GPU reservations. Ray comparisons never call Helm.
- **Unreachable is a failure, not a skip**: `create_backend_for_run()` asserts before handing back a backend, since exiting 0 would report green for a test that never ran.
- **Namespaced probes only**: never a cluster-scoped CRD read, which the workbench's Role cannot do.

### Generate Debug Rollout Data

- **Who uses it**: modes with `has_real_rollout == False`, through `--load-debug-rollout-data --debug-train-only`.
- **Where it comes from**: `prepare()` in `conftest_ft/execution.py`, via `U.hf_download_dataset()` on `fzyzcjy/miles-test-rollout-Qwen3-30B-A3B-5layer`.
- **Soak reuse**: `materialize_cyclic_debug_rollout_data()` symlinks the recorded files cyclically under the shared data dir, so a soak can run more steps than were recorded and the run pod can read the links.
- **Regenerating it needs the 5-layer model**: the full model's `rollout_log_probs` are incompatible with the 5-layer training model and produce NaN GRPO gradients.

```bash
# 1. Generate with the 5-layer model and real sglang engines (no dumper)
PYTHONPATH=. python tests/e2e/ft/conftest_ft/scenario_trainer_no_failure.py generate-data \
    --mode kill_train__dp2_cp2__moe_5layer --num-steps 12 --output-dir /tmp/gen_rollout

# 2. Inspect
ls /tmp/gen_rollout/rollout_data/

# 3. Upload
hf upload --repo-type dataset fzyzcjy/miles-test-rollout-Qwen3-30B-A3B-5layer \
    /tmp/gen_rollout/rollout_data/
```

## Test Specifications

### Comparison Criterion

- **Dumps**: per-tensor predicates over `rel` / `max_abs` / `mean_abs`, as `compare_dumps(diff_thresholds=[(name_regex, predicate), ...])` onto the sglang comparator's `--diff-threshold`.
- **Fail-closed**: a tensor matching no regex fails, so every list ends with a `.*` catch-all and the specific families come first.
- **Model inputs**: `INPUT_TENSORS_ALLOW_FAILED_PATTERN` exempts `input_ids`, `positions`, `cu_seqlens_*`, `qkv_format`; `INPUT_TENSORS_SKIP_PATTERN` skips those plus `.*witness.*`. Nothing else is exempt.
- **Metrics**: `compare_metrics` reads `MetricEvent`s, requires `train/grad_norm` and `train/loss` in the baseline and equal event counts on both sides, and compares only the highest-attempt event per rollout id.

- **Why only some are bitwise**: baseline and target reduce over different topologies, so allreduce kernel ordering differs — unless `--deterministic-mode` and `--debug-deterministic-collective` are on.
- **Why `train/grad_norm` is exempt in `scenario_trainer_deterministic`**: it sums squared shard fragments, so its bracketing follows the dist-optimizer shard count (8 flat vs 2 per cell); a few fp32 ulps are inherent. The grads stay bitwise-checked through the dumps. It is exact in `scenario_rollout_deterministic`, where ft on rollout alone leaves one trainer topology and no shard-count bracketing to excuse.

### Fault Forms and Receivers

| Backend | Cell type | Forms, drawn from uniformly |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ray | actor | `inject_fault:kill_process`, `inject_fault:exit_process`, `inject_fault:segfault_process` |
| ray | rollout | `inject_fault:kill_process` |
| kubernetes | actor | those three kills, plus `delete_pod` |
| kubernetes | rollout | `exec_sigkill`, `exec_sigstop`, `delete_pod` |

- **Each fault action is its own form**: pod deletion is a quarter of a kubernetes trainer injection, not half of it.
- **The actor class decides what a kill means**, since an injection carries only an action and a target: `TrainRayActor` and `ServeActor` crash their own process, the only thing that costs torchft a member, while `CommandActor` SIGKILLs the isolated process group rooted at the engine subprocess. That includes the launch shell and every engine child it spawned, so a dead cell cannot leave an orphaned scheduler holding GPU memory while its replacement starts; the Ray actor observes the subprocess exit and reports the death as production sees it.
- **Why an engine never exits or segfaults**: exiting and segfaulting are what a process does to itself from the inside, and no signal reproduces them from outside — SIGTERM is a clean shutdown, SIGSEGV is delivered rather than provoked. An engine takes SIGKILL, plus SIGSTOP on kubernetes; the soak asks it for nothing else.
- **How a kubernetes engine takes a kill**: its pod runs sglang as the entrypoint (`BaseCommandSpec`), so no actor and no rpc server exist to receive a fault hook. The kill is delivered from outside instead, as a `kubectl exec` SIGKILL of the sglang processes in the engine container, and deleting the pod is the second, coarser form — the engine *is* the pod.
- **Deletion is the test layer's own**: the async Kubernetes client deletes the observed pod under UID and resource-version preconditions, timeout-bounded, and waits until that UID is absent. It models an outsider, and deliberately avoids the production heal path `KubernetesCellOperations.suspend`, whose bugs an injector sharing it would hide.

### `scenario_trainer_no_failure`

```
Type: comparison (baseline=normal DP, target=indep_dp)
Steps: 2 (NUM_STEPS)
Compare: dumps rel <= 0.0085; metrics rtol=1e-2, atol=1e-8

1. Baseline: normal DP on debug rollout data (real engines in a real-rollout mode)
2. Target: the same arguments plus get_ft_args(mode), which is --use-fault-tolerance
   --ft-components <the mode's ft_components> --api-server-port 0
3. Real-rollout mode only, both sides: --debug-deterministic-collective --clip-grad 10.0, as in
   scenario_trainer_with_failure's kill_train__dp2_cp2 mode, so the weights stay bitwise equal
   across the two topologies and the live temperature-0.8 samples of every rollout match
4. Compare:
   - Tensor-level: compare_dumps (weights, grads via dumper & sglang comparator)
   - Metric-level: compare_metrics (MetricEvent, requires train/grad_norm and train/loss)
   - Rank matching: grouping_skip_keys=["rank", "dp", "edp"], the two sides differing in
     world size and DP layout

Roughly equal, not bitwise - allreduce kernel ordering differs across topologies.
```

### `scenario_trainer_with_failure`

```
Type: comparison, multi-phase (phase_a + phase_b)
Steps: phase_a 1 rollout (id 0), phase_b 3 rollouts (ids 1..3)
  --num-rollout 4: exclusive global end id, not a per-run count
Compare: phase_b dumps per rollout, rel <= 0.0085 plus the max_abs floors below;
         metrics rtol=5e-2, atol=1e-7

Phase A (both sides):
  1. Run 1 rollout
  2. Save checkpoint (--save-interval 1), exit

Phase B - baseline:
  1. Resume from the phase_a checkpoint
  2. Run 3 normal rollouts (1..3)

Phase B - target:
  1. Resume from the phase_a checkpoint
  2. Rollout 1: N cells normal
  3. Rollout 2, attempt 0: exit_process at trainer_step_before_allreduce on last cell rank 0
     -> os._exit(1) -> allreduce timeout -> should_commit=false -> retry
  4. Rollout 2, attempt 1: reconfigure to N-1 cells, commit on the degraded quorum
  5. After rollout 2: stop_cell(last) + start_cell(last) at trainer_controller_step_end
  6. Rollout 3: heal back to N cells, train with the healed cell

Fault injection: --ci-fault-hooks, JSON list of FaultHookRequest {request_id, hook_name, action, target {cell_id, rank},
  rollout_id, attempt, weight_version, delay_ms}; the same requests can be set at runtime through the api server
  hook_name trainer_step_before_allreduce: inside the targeted actor rank, matched on rollout_id and attempt
  hook_name trainer_controller_step_end: trainer controller, actions stop_cell / start_cell via cell_operations
  action exit_process / kill_process / stop_process / deadlock_thread: os._exit(1), SIGKILL, SIGSTOP or hang the reaching thread

Healing witness: target phase_b event dir, exactly two CellReconfigureEvents
  rollout 2: shrink, alive N -> N-1
  rollout 3: heal, healed = last cell, ckpt src = cell 0, alive back to N
  baseline and phase_a dirs: zero
Dump-leaf witness: {fwd_bwd/rollout_<id> leaf dirs} == {rollouts the comparison loop walks}
```

- **Why the healing witness**: without it the comparison degenerates into two fault-free runs that trivially agree; the shrink proves the injection fired.
- **Why the dump-leaf witness**: a newly added leaf dir would otherwise skip comparison unnoticed.

Grad families with a `max_abs` floor (cancellation-dominated near-zero grads; real grads sit around `1e-2`):

| Rollouts | Families | Floor |
| --- | --- | --- |
| all | MoE expert grads, QK-norm (`q_layernorm` / `k_layernorm`) grads | `max_abs <= 1e-3` |
| injected ones, real-rollout mode only | QK-norms, folded `layer_norm_weight`s, `linear_qkv` / `linear_proj` / `mlp.linear_fc[12]` weights | `max_abs <= 3e-3` |

- **Where `3e-3` comes from**: the degraded commit's ulp drift lands as <= 2.8e-3 absolute noise in those near-zero grads (40 tensors, 2026-06-12), against real grads around `1e-2`. Embedding, output, final-norm grads, every activation and every pre-fault rollout keep the strict set.

#### `kill_train__dp2_cp2` mode

`scenario_trainer_with_failure` against live generation: real sglang engines, deterministic inference, temperature 0.8.

- **Pre-fault rollouts need bitwise weights on both sides**: the fault rollout trains the target's own live samples, and one bf16 ulp in a weight flips temperature-0.8 samples so the fault rollout trains different data (observed as a 6% `train/grad_norm` gap once the sglang v0.5.18 bump changed the sampled content). Both sides therefore run `--debug-deterministic-collective` (the same fixed fold for the normal-DP 4-rank reduce and the indep_dp CP-then-cross-cell reduce, as in `scenario_trainer_deterministic`) and `--clip-grad 10.0` (clipping inactive: the dense grad norm is ~1.3, and `train/grad_norm` differs by a few fp32 ulps across shardings, which an active clip would multiply into every update). The other FT modes have grad norms below 1.0, so clipping is inactive there without the override.
- **Post-fault rollouts are injected**: `--ci-inject-rollout-data-path` replays the baseline's `--save-debug-rollout-data` recording from rollout 3 on (crash rollout + 1).
- **Why inject**: the degraded-quorum commit brackets microbatch accumulation differently, and under live sampling that ulp diff flips tokens until the two runs' rollout data diverges wholesale. It is fault-inherent -- no collective ordering removes it. Injecting makes training inputs identical by construction, keeping the comparison strict.
- **The target stays real**: engines and generation still run (samples discarded), `update_weights` fires after the degraded commit and after healing, the health monitor pauses and resumes — the whole crash → retry → heal → weight-sync path. Engine checksums are not compared here; only `scenario_trainer_deterministic` does that.
- **Generation is still asserted**: `RolloutDataInjectionUtil.assert_matches_generated` requires bitwise-identical prompt tokens per sample, plus a mean response-token match ratio above `--ci-inject-rollout-data-min-match-ratio`, set to 0.5 here (the flag's own default is 0.9). A broken `update_weights` drops that ratio by ~2 orders.
- **Not asserted**: exact post-fault sampled content beyond the ratio; pre-fault rollouts are compared for real.

Guard calibration (2026-06-12, first post-fault rollout, 256 samples, correct weights; a response counts as mismatched from its first flipped token on):

| Model | Mean response-token match | Min |
| --- | --- | --- |
| dense Qwen3-0.6B | **0.63** | 0.035 |
| 5-layer MoE | **0.19** | 0.005 |

- **Why dense**: on the truncated MoE, uncalibrated logits plus router near-ties amplify the drift to 0.19, indistinguishable from unrelated content; dense's 0.63 sits 2 orders above that, so 0.5 separates them.

### `scenario_trainer_deterministic`

```
Type: comparison, multi-phase (phase_a + phase_b)
Steps: 3 rollouts per phase - phase_a 0..2, phase_b 3..5
  --num-rollout 6: exclusive global end id
  --debug-exit-after-rollout 3: counts within the run, fires after that rollout's ckpt save
  --save-interval 3 (NUM_ROLLOUTS_PER_PHASE): one ckpt at each phase's last rollout
Compare: BOTH phases' dumps rel <= 0 (bitwise); metrics rtol=0 / atol=0, except
         train/grad_norm at rtol=1e-6

One shared builder parameterized by the phase's start rollout id P; only the start regime differs:
  phase_a: cold start (no --load, so no_load_optim/no_load_rng/finetune) - rollouts 0..2 (P=0)
  phase_b: resumes from phase_a's post-healing rollout-2 ckpt (start_rollout_id = loaded + 1
           = 3) - rollouts 3..5 (P=3)

Per-phase baseline: rollouts P..P+2 all normal, no stop/start, no healing

Per-phase target:
  1. Rollout P, P+1: all N cells normal
  2. After rollout P+1: stop_cell(last) + start_cell(last) at trainer_controller_step_end
  3. Rollout P+2: heal at the start (recv_ckpt from cell 0), then normal execution

Determinism: --deterministic-mode, plus NCCL_ALGO=Ring, NVTE_ALLOW_NONDETERMINISTIC_ALGO=0,
  CUBLAS_WORKSPACE_CONFIG=:4096:8, SGLANG_FLASHINFER_PREFILL_SPLIT_TILE_SIZE=8192
  --debug-deterministic-collective: fixed-tree SUM folds, making normal DP's and indep_dp's
    reduction topologies bitwise-comparable

Cross-cell check: --use-fault-tolerance --ft-components train auto-enables
  --save-local-weight-checksum and --enable-event-analyzer
  cross_replica_weight_checksum: cell-to-cell bitwise equality, every rollout attempt,
    post-healing included
Engine checksum (real-rollout modes only): one InferenceEngineWeightChecksumEvent per
  published weight version, carrying every updated engine's checksum
  _compare, per phase: baseline and target pushed identical weights per weight version
  inference_engine_weight_checksum_consistency: all engines of one weight version agree

Healing witness: one heal per target phase, at P+2 (healed = last cell, ckpt src = cell 0,
  alive back to N); no standalone shrink - one _refresh_cells absorbs the stop+start pair
  the event dir is snapshotted into the ckpt and restored on --load, hence:
    target phase_a: heal at rollout 2
    target phase_b: heal at rollout 2 (restored with the ckpt) + heal at rollout 5
    both baselines: zero reconfigure events
```

- **Why P+2 must exist**: healing runs at its start, so a shorter phase never executes the path under test.
- **Why zero tolerance**: a state-copy bug in healing is easy to make and an approximate check would miss it.
- **What phase_b adds**: reproducing the baseline bit-for-bit also proves the ckpt round-trips bitwise.
- **Why the healing witness**: it gates the off-by-one bug where healing never runs and the comparison passes on two fault-free runs.

### `scenario_rollout_deterministic`

```
Type: comparison; both sides run the identical command through run_cell_soak, the comparison
      app's run_side; the baseline side declares no targets, so it is never faulted
Entry: test_rollout_deterministic__kill_rollout__dp4.py, ft-long
Steps: 8 rollouts (NUM_ROLLOUTS)
Requires: mode.has_real_rollout, and ft_components == ("rollout",) exactly
Compare: dumps rel <= 0 (bitwise); metrics rtol=0 / atol=0 over train/* and rollout/*,
         train/grad_norm included

Regime (both sides):
  - the shared deterministic rollout recipe: --sglang-enable-deterministic-inference,
    --sglang-attention-backend flashinfer, --deterministic-mode and --sglang-disable-overlap-schedule
  - --debug-deterministic-collective and scenario_trainer_deterministic's deterministic env vars
  - --sglang-disable-radix-cache
  - --update-weight-transfer-mode p2p --sglang-router-policy round_robin: disaggregated P2P only
  - --sglang-remote-instance-weight-loader-start-seed-via-transfer-engine: the engines must start their transfer engine for trainers to write into them
  - --rollout-health-check-interval 1

Injection (target side only):
  1. Rollout cells, seed 42, exponential mean CRASH_INTERVAL_SECONDS (30s)
  2. Forms drawn per (cluster backend, cell type), as in the soaks
  3. start_after_rollout_id=0: no fault is admitted before rollout 0 finishes as a normal step
  4. SoakTailConfig.create(num_rollout=8) closes admission once rollout 4 finishes, leaving the
     final three rollouts for recovery
  5. After the runner returns: assert_min_injections (>= 2 rollout injections),
     assert_injections_recovered (every applied fault recovered, as its form defines it) and
     assert_faults_span_progress_windows (faults land in >= MIN_FAULT_PROGRESS_WINDOWS (2)
     windows separated by completed rollouts)

Assertions:
  1. Reconfigure events: zero on BOTH sides - crashing an engine must not reconfigure trainer cells
  2. Metrics: rtol=atol=0 over train/* and rollout/*
  3. Dumps: rel <= 0
  4. Engine checksums: baseline and target pushed identical weights per weight version
  5. Weights moved, per side: the engine weight checksum is not identical across all weight versions
```

- **Why it exists**: an engine dying and a fresh one taking over mid-generation is supposed to be invisible to training, and "invisible" is a claim about bits; the rollout soak asserts survival only.
- **Why the shared deterministic recipe**: the assertion is deterministic replay across fresh inference engines, not true-on-policy training. Reusing the same FlashInfer recipe as the main deterministic trainer-FT test avoids a second, incompatible attention-backend contract.
- **Why the shared recipe disables the overlap scheduler**: the rollout health check calls SGLang's `/health_generate`, a greedy one-token request. Under the overlap scheduler it joins the running decode batch before its finish is known, and SGLang does not recompute the batch's sampling-path flags when it leaves, so the temperature-only rollout requests keep sampling through the top-k path, which hashes sorted ranks instead of token ids: seeded requests then draw different tokens from bitwise identical distributions (5 of 160 rollouts across repeated no-fault runs, 0 of 160 with overlap off). Without overlap the one-token request finishes before it can join.
- **Why `--sglang-disable-radix-cache`**: a replacement engine serves with a cold prefix cache where the baseline's was warm, and deterministic inference is nowhere documented as prefix-cache-length invariant.
- **Why this recipe disables batch-variant MM fallback**: a rollout worker loss changes co-batching while the pool is healing; permitting an `einsum` fallback would make the same seeded request depend on that temporary batch shape. The scenario injects the environment override without changing the production default.
- **Why `--rollout-health-check-interval 1`**: healthy generation can finish between two five-second polls; the short scenario needs at least one fresh Serving observation for its rollout witness.
- **Why this scenario polls the fault window every 0.2 seconds**: generation windows are only a few seconds long, so the generic two-second scheduler cadence can miss every Serving observation in an eight-rollout run.
- **Why one quiescent poll on Ray only**: a fault may land during a weight update by design, so a stable-serving gate would only delay it. On Kubernetes the rollout forms (`exec_sigkill`, `exec_sigstop`, `delete_pod`) keep the generic 60-poll gate.
- **Why the final three rollouts accept no new fault**: the runner keeps observing recovery after admission closes, so teardown cannot race a newly accepted replacement.
- **Why the progress-window witness**: faults confined to one window between completed rollouts only show that one rollout survived a fault, not that faults cost the run nothing across its rollouts.
- **Why every namespace, not just `train/`**: an engine crash shows up first in `rollout/raw_reward` or `rollout/log_probs`. `perf/` is left out by name, being wall-clock and throughput that a relaunch moves by definition, and a metric in neither namespace fails the run rather than being dropped quietly.
- **Why the weights-moved gate**: bitwise equality is also satisfied by two runs that trained on nothing.
- **Why not a loss or reward curve**: neither is a progress signal here — the reward is `deterministic_random`, a hash of the response, and GRPO's surrogate loss is not monotone even while a run learns. Over eight rollouts neither moves for a reason worth asserting, and the weights either changed or they did not.

### `scenario_trainer_all_gather_fault`

```
Type: comparison; both sides run the deterministic P2P recipe of scenario_rollout_deterministic,
      the target side with --ci-fault-hooks
Entry: test_trainer_all_gather_fault__kill_train__dp2_tp2.py, ft-short
Steps: 8 rollouts (NUM_ROLLOUTS)
Requires: mode.has_real_rollout, and ft_components == ("train",) exactly
Extra ft: the target also enables rollout ft (extra_ft_components): an engine a faulted trainer
          never finished sending to is marked errored, and only rollout ft replaces it; no rollout
          fault is declared, so the mode name still says the run crashes only trainers
Compare: dumps rel <= 0 (bitwise); metrics rtol=0 / atol=0 over train/* and rollout/*

Faults (target side only), declared at launch, all on the last cell's rank 0 at
trainer_weight_update_before_all_gather:
  1. Rollout 1: kill_process
  2. Rollout 3: stop_process (SIGSTOP)
  3. Rollout 5: deadlock_thread
  --update-weights-timeout 120: the controller gives a stopped or deadlocked cell up after 120s
  Rollouts 2, 4 and 6: sleep 90s at trainer_controller_step_start, before the refresh. A heal
  (mini FT controller poll, resume delay, relaunch) takes ~40s against ~16s steps, and the trainer
  does not wait for a healing cell, so without the pause the next rollout would train without it

Assertions:
  1. Reconfigure events: zero on the baseline; on the target exactly one heal per fault, at
     rollouts 2, 4 and 6 (healed = last cell, ckpt src = cell 0, alive back to N)
  2. Metrics, dumps, engine checksums, weights moved, gradients nonzero: as
     scenario_rollout_deterministic
  3. Every declared hook request ends FIRED (FaultHookEvent in the target's event log)
  4. Every fault rollout still publishes a weight version (WeightUpdateResultEvent), so the
     engines never generate on stale weights
```

- **Why it exists**: a trainer rank dying, freezing or hanging in the middle of the tensor all-gather that feeds a weight update must cost training nothing, and "nothing" is a claim about bits; the soaks only assert survival.
- **Why declared at launch**: the fault lands at the exact hook and rollout the plan names, so a failure reproduces from the plan alone, with no scheduler or observation latency in the way.
- **Why three actions in one run**: kill, stop and deadlock reach the controller through three different paths (actor death, the update-weights timeout on a frozen rank, the same timeout on a hung thread), and each heal has to leave the trainer bit-identical before the next fault lands.
- **Why the heal witness**: without it the comparison passes on two fault-free runs.
- **Calibration**: the 120-second update-weights timeout and the CI estimate have not been calibrated by a run.

### `scenario_p2p_send_receiver_fault`

```
Type: comparison; both sides run the deterministic P2P recipe of scenario_rollout_deterministic,
      the target side with --ci-fault-hooks
Entry: test_p2p_send_receiver_fault__kill_rollout__dp2_tp2.py, ft-short
Steps: 8 rollouts (NUM_ROLLOUTS)
Requires: mode.has_real_rollout, ft_components == ("rollout",) exactly, and the ray backend
Compare: dumps rel <= 0 (bitwise); metrics rtol=0 / atol=0 over train/* and rollout/*

Fault (target side only), declared at launch on trainer cell 0 rank 0 at
trainer_weight_update_before_send, rollout 3, 50 ms after the hook is reached:
  api_server_fault: the sending rank asks the api server for engine cell 0's observed fault
  target and sets an immediate kill_process on it, so the receiver dies while its weights are
  still in flight

Assertions:
  1. Reconfigure events: zero on BOTH sides - crashing an engine must not reconfigure trainer cells
  2. Metrics, dumps, engine checksums, weights moved, gradients nonzero: as
     scenario_rollout_deterministic
  3. The declared hook request ends FIRED (FaultHookEvent in the target's event log)
  4. WeightUpdateResultEvent: rollout 3 fails exactly the killed engine's cell, every other
     rollout fails none
```

- **Why it exists**: `scenario_rollout_deterministic` kills engines at random wall-clock moments, so a run can pass without ever losing a receiver in the middle of a transfer; this pins the fault to that moment.
- **Why the sender pulls the trigger**: only the sending rank knows when the transfer is about to start; going through the api server keeps the kill on the same route the soaks use, bound to the receiver's observed incarnation, so a stale target fails loudly instead of killing a replacement.
- **Why 50 ms**: long enough for the first writes to be in flight, far shorter than the transfer, so the kill lands inside it on every run; the delay is fixed, not drawn, so both sides stay deterministic.
- **Why the failed-cell witness**: the update has to record the receiver as failed in exactly that rollout, so a kill that landed after the transfer finished cannot pass as the fault under test.
- **Calibration**: the 50 ms delay and the CI estimate have not been calibrated by a run.

### `scenario_inference_scaling`

```
Type: soak (no baseline, no compare); kubernetes only, the pool is a LeaderWorkerSet there
Entry: test_inference_scaling__kill_rollout.py, no mode: topology pinned in conftest_ft/scaling.py
Steps: 12 rollouts (SCALING_NUM_ROLLOUTS)
Layout: dense Qwen3-0.6B, 2 cells x CP2 on 4 train GPUs + 2 engines x 1 GPU, disaggregated,
        --ft-components rollout, api server + mini ft controller; 7 GPUs at the peak

Mechanism: run_cell_soak with one target kind, "pool": the observer lists the engine pool as a
        PoolTarget (LeaderWorkerSet replicas read through kubectl + its rollout cells), and the
        only form is ResizePoolForm (tests/utils/soak/ft/actions/resize.py), drawn every poll. Once
        the run is in the scheduled rollout (2 -> 3 in rollout 2, 3 -> 2 in rollout 7) it
        relaunches the run through the launcher with --rollout-num-gpus set for the new size,
        which only creates or deletes engine pods; a rollout already trained fails the soak. The
        resize counts as recovered once every engine cell is Serving and there are exactly
        replicas of them; it must show in the run within LANDING_LAG_ROLLOUTS (3) rollouts.

Assertions:
  1. Soak: every resize returned and recovered, a normal step in the tail, final observation
     alive and ready
  2. Both resizes applied in order, the pool reading 2 -> 3 -> 2 replicas
  3. train/grad_norm finite and nonzero for all 12 rollouts
  4. Engines the weights of each rollout reached (InferenceEngineWeightChecksumEvent of the
     update before it) follow 2 / 3 / 2, each landing within the lag window
```

- **Why through the launcher**: scaling is relaunching the run with a new size, as an operator does; the launcher admits a change of pool replicas as a scaling, and no other workload of the run is recreated.
- **Why the engines of the update before a rollout**: the weights published after rollout r are what rollout r + 1 generates with, so that is the rollout an engine joining or leaving there shows in.

### `scenario_trainer_scaling`

```
Type: soak (no baseline, no compare); kubernetes only, the pool is a LeaderWorkerSet there
Entry: test_trainer_scaling__kill_train.py, no mode: topology pinned in conftest_ft/scaling.py
Steps: 12 rollouts (SCALING_NUM_ROLLOUTS)
Layout: as scenario_inference_scaling with --ft-components train (indep_dp); 8 GPUs at the peak

Mechanism: as scenario_inference_scaling, relaunching with --actor-num-gpus-per-node set for the
        new size (one 2-GPU pod = one cell): the trainer controller sees the pod through its
        watch, and the next step's refresh heals the new cell into the quorum (checkpoint from
        cell 0) or shrinks the quorum to the survivors. Recovered once every actor cell is Healthy
        and there are exactly replicas of them.

Assertions:
  1. - 3. as scenario_inference_scaling
  4. Cells in the one TrainGroupStepEndEvent of each rollout follow 2 / 3 / 2 within the lag
     windows; every cell reports NORMAL, except that the cell a shrink removes may report
     "error" inside the shrink's lag window
```

- **Why the removed cell may report "error"**: the trainer does not retry a step whose surviving cells all report NORMAL after one cell failed (the gradients were already exchanged), so a shrink landing late in a step leaves that step's final attempt with the removed cell as "error".
- **Why only above the deployed size**: the controller waits for its deployed cell count at init and on reload, so a pool scaled below it would hang a later restart of the run.

### `scenario_random_crash`

```
Type: soak (no baseline, no compare); passes if training completes without hanging and the
      witnesses hold
Steps: 60 (default)
CLI: --mode, --seed (42), --num-steps (60), --trainer-crash-interval-seconds (120),
     --rollout-crash-interval-seconds (240), --fully-async (off), --fault-triggers (timer hook)

Targeting and assertions follow the mode's ft_components:
  ("train",)          -> inject into "actor" cells, assert trainer healing
  ("rollout",)        -> inject into "rollout" cells, assert the recovery cycle
  ("train","rollout") -> inject into both kinds, assert both
  A mode declaring rollout ft without real engines would schedule injections into a cell kind
    that does not exist, so FTTestMode refuses to be constructed at all

Architecture (external fault injection, not inside the training loop):
  1. Start indep_dp training + api server + --mini-ft-controller-enable, in a worker thread
     of the test process
  2. SoakRunner (tests/utils/soak/core/) iterates every 2s on one asyncio loop:
     a. Observe the targeted cells and append the snapshot to the event log
     b. Admit nothing until every earlier action has recovered
     c. Collect the cell kinds whose own schedule is due; stop here if none
     d. A due kind is ready only at a quiescent point: every expected replica present, Running and
        not failing its health check for 60 consecutive polls (~120s); a checker paused by a
        weight update reads Unknown, which is not a failure; every request resets its kind's streak
     e. Draw a ready kind and one of its fault forms - preferring one the log shows has never
        worked - then a cell that form may hit: all replicas ready, >= 2 of them when the
        form harms its target
     f. Record the request, apply it as its own task, and draw that kind's next injection
        time once the fault is applied
  3. The immediate fault hook kills the actor's process; on kubernetes the test layer also signals
     engine processes or deletes the pod
  4. The mini FT controller recovers the cell (suspend -> resume)
  5. Admission closes once rollout num_steps - max(3, num_steps // 5) - 1 finishes
  6. Whether training passes or fails: close admission, a final observation in which every
     action must have returned and recovered, teardown, then the evidence archive

Per-kind schedules: exponential, mean that kind's --*-crash-interval-seconds

Witnesses, counted per kind:
  forms   -> every form the enabled components make available applied at least once
  train   -> >= 2 applied actor injections, each recovered: a new incarnation of the same
             cell ready and named by a CellReconfigureEvent healing that index, then a
             normal training step
  rollout -> >= 2 applied rollout injections, each recovered: a new incarnation of the same
             cell observed Serving, then a normal training step
  tail    -> every action returned and recovered, then a normal training step after
             admission closed
  end     -> the last successful observation, taken after the last fault, holds every expected
             cell of each kind alive and ready and has no errors (a finished training run takes
             its api server down, so the polls after its exit fail and are skipped)

Faults are random, so beyond the witnesses no exact sequence is asserted.
```

- **Why per-kind schedules and counting**: each kind's cadence stays what it would be in a single-kind soak, and the trainer assertion reads only `actor` injections while the rollout one reads only `rollout` — a mixed soak cannot let one kind's crashes pay for the other's missing heal.
- **Why rollout gets the longer interval**: the replacement pays a full sglang launch plus a weight sync before it can serve again.
- **No per-kind quota**: when the trainer has no spare replica for a long stretch every injection lands on rollout, and the failure form is a loud "too few trainer injections" rather than a silent pass.
- **Why injections wait for quiescence**: the api server reports a just-killed cell Healthy for ~95s, far longer than the poll interval, and indep_dp cannot heal from zero survivors, so a naive Healthy count would eventually kill the last replica. A 60-poll all-healthy streak (~120s) outlasts that window.
- **Why quiescence counts replicas against `SoakTargetConfig.expected_count`**: a deleted pod vanishes from the listing rather than reading unhealthy, and the survivors all read healthy; only the missing replica says the kind is still recovering.
- **Why every enabled form has to land**: the floors count injections, not forms, so `inject_fault:kill_process` alone could clear them while `delete_pod` is never tried. This witness makes the draw's preference for an untried form binding.
- **Why every injection recovers on its own cell**: a floor of ">= 2 healings" passes whenever the last crash never recovered. The default intervals are short enough that a soak reliably clears the floors.
- **Why the step budget is 60**: a rollout injection needs a 60-poll (~120s) quiescent streak plus a mean-240s exponential wait, so the second accepted rollout injection the witness demands takes well over ten minutes. The budget buys that time instead of lowering the quiescence gate that keeps the injector from killing a kind's last live replica.
- **Why the rollout witness is one-sided**: sampled polls miss windows by construction, so it never demands seeing the down half of a recovery. It demands a new incarnation of the cell observed Serving after the fault applied; a stale Healthy reading of the old incarnation cannot satisfy it.
- **Evidence**: typed events in `<dump_dir>-soak/<session_id>/events.jsonl`, requests flushed before dispatch; after teardown the training-event logs, discarded generations included, are copied under `sources/` with SHA-256 digests, and the checks read those copies.
- **Code**: the soak engine lives in `tests/utils/soak/core/`, the FT forms, observers and checkers in `tests/utils/soak/ft/`.
- **Random transfer coverage**: every real-rollout random soak uses P2P weight transfer; fake-rollout modes keep trainer-only coverage and never exercise weight transfer.
- **Checksum observation**: the harness requests an event directory with `--save-debug-event-data`, which turns `--log-inference-engine-weight-checksums` on by default, so in real-rollout modes each published weight version records per-tensor engine checksums bound to its version, update and engine incarnation, collected under a five-second timeout; a missed observation loses evidence and fails the test, not training. Small observation overhead is accepted; production recovery and ordering remain unchanged.
- **Checksum witness**: the analyzer rule `inference_engine_weight_checksum_coverage` requires every settled published weight update to carry exactly one checksum record covering the engine incarnations it updated, and `inference_engine_weight_checksum_consistency` requires same-version engines to agree; both run before every training step, so a run's last publication is the one publication no rule sees.
- **Movement**: the analyzer rule `inference_engine_weight_movement` fails the analysis when the tensor set changes between adjacent settled versions, and only logs a warning when a tensor keeps its checksum (a bf16 tensor such as a norm weight can stay unchanged for thousands of steps at a small learning rate) within one trainer load state of a model, with an unchanged tensor set; LoRA and update intervals other than one disable it, read from the trainer ranks' environment reports, but never same-version consistency.
- **Fault triggers**: `--fault-triggers` picks which triggers the scheduler draws from. `timer` is the wall-clock scheduler: an exponential interval elapses and the drawn form fires at once. `hook` binds the drawn form to a named trainer fault hook (`trainer_weight_update_before_all_gather`, `trainer_weight_update_before_send`) with a delay drawn uniformly from 0 to 1000 ms (the deadlock stays immediate), so the fault lands inside a weight update; the deadlock is drawn only at `trainer_weight_update_before_all_gather`, because the send hook runs on a per-engine writer thread whose hang fails that engine's update and replaces the engine, leaving the trainer the form targets healthy; the random_crash and gsm8k soaks turn the all-gather forms off (`weight_update_all_gathers=False`), because the hook is reached only when a weight update all-gathers (TP, EP or ETP above 1) and every real-rollout topology they run is CP-only; it adds `--update-weights-timeout 600`. Both together mix the two through one scheduler, and both are on by default; every enabled form must produce an effect. Fake-rollout modes never run a weight update, so no trainer fault hook is ever reached there: the default drops `hook` for them and asking for it explicitly is refused.
- **One mechanism**: `create_cell_fault_forms` builds one form list per trigger, `_create_timer_forms` and `_create_hook_forms`, each split by cluster backend the same way. Every cell fault is an `InjectFaultForm` posting one `FaultHookRequest` through the api server's `fault-hook` route, bound to the observed fault target; a request without a hook name executes at once, one with a hook name waits for the worker to reach it. The cell's effect is read the same way in both cases.
- **Receiver faults through a trainer hook**: with rollout ft on the ray backend, the `hook` trigger also draws a rollout form that sets the hook on another healthy trainer cell with an `api_server_fault` action wrapping `kill_process`, so the sending trainer itself kills the receiver at `trainer_weight_update_before_send`; no runner round trip separates hook arrival from receiver failure. Kubernetes pod forms stay timer-only.
- **Hook witnesses**: every applied hook form needs exactly one worker-side dispatch with its recorded hook name and delay (`tests/utils/soak/ft/checkers/fault_hook_dispatch.py`), every receiver fault needs its target in the failed engines of the exact weight update the hook fired in, and every trainer fault needs an original peer to finish a normal step afterwards (`tests/utils/soak/ft/checkers/trainer_peer_progress.py`). The normal healing and tail witnesses remain mandatory.
- **Calibration**: the 300-second hook lifetime, the 1000 ms delay bound and the 4800-second CI estimate have not been calibrated by a run.

### `scenario_realistic_gsm8k`

```
Type: soak (no baseline run; reference = the baseline test's wandb curves)
Entry: test_realistic_gsm8k__kill_train_rollout.py, no mode variants
CLI: --seed (42), --num-rollout (250), --trainer-crash-interval-seconds (300),
     --rollout-crash-interval-seconds (1200), --metric-threshold (0.55), --fully-async (off),
     --fault-triggers (timer hook); no --mode

Recipe: Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct, GRPO, 250 rollouts, over the gsm8k RL recipe of
        tests/e2e/long/test_qwen2.5_0.5B_gsm8k.py, whose regular CI runs are the no-fault
        reference wandb curves
Layout: mirrors kill_train__dp2_cp2__moe_5layer - 2 cells x CP2 on 4 train GPUs + 4 rollout engines
        x 1 GPU, disaggregated
Faults: scenario_random_crash's soak runner (run_cell_soak over prepare_gsm8k_run's run), with
        --ft-components train rollout asked for outright, so both trainer cells and engines crash;
        --fault-triggers, its train args and its hook witnesses are the same as scenario_random_crash's
        (tests/utils/soak/ft/fault_triggers.py)

Assertions:
  1. --ci-metric-checker-key eval/gsm8k against a threshold that must stay identical to the
     no-fault baseline's (0.55); passes if ANY eval reaches it
  2. assert_healing, shared with scenario_random_crash, so the trainer and rollout injection
     floors, their recovery witnesses and the every-enabled-form witness apply here

Fault recovery must not cost end-to-end learning, which the comparison scenarios cannot observe.
```

- **Why the threshold does not move**: it is the entire value of this scenario, so engine crashes are paid for with a lower rollout crash rate, never with a lower bar.

### `scenario_random_crash_fully_async` and `scenario_realistic_gsm8k_fully_async`

```
Type: shells - each calls its sync twin with fully_async=True and pins nothing else
Entries: test_random_crash_fully_async__kill_train_rollout__dp2_cp2.py,
         test_realistic_gsm8k_fully_async__kill_train_rollout.py (no mode)
Differs from the twin: train_async.py instead of train.py, plus --fully-async
                       --pause-generation-mode in_place; test name gains a _fully_async suffix,
                       which separates the dump dirs, and for the gsm8k twin the wandb run
Same as the twin: model, parallelism, batch sizes, CLI and every assertion, by construction
```

- **Why it matters**: production fully-async keeps the engines generating across weight updates, so a crash lands the system in states no strictly-alternating soak reaches.
- **Why `--pause-generation-mode in_place`**: the default retract mode can deadlock `flush_cache` under load, and a soak whose verdict is "training finished without hanging" cannot tell that deadlock from the failure it exists to catch.
- **Asserted before the cluster comes up**: `scenario_random_crash_fully_async`'s mode has real engines. Recorded rollout data would prove nothing about generating while training.
- **Deliberately uncovered**: `train_async.py` without `--fully-async`, the strictly easier case, at tens of minutes to hours of 8-GPU time per soak.
