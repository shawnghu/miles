# miles.kernels

Every hand-written training kernel in miles, filed by the op it computes.

## Layout

│   │   └── tilelang/     one kernel pair; RoPE tail (GLM-5, DSv3.2) and attention sink (DSv4) are

## Rules

- **Filed by op, not by model or backend.** The backend (TileLang, Triton, CuTe, CUDA) is a
  filename prefix or a subdirectory inside the op, never a top-level axis. Adding a second
  backend for an op is a sibling file, not a new tree.
- **One entry function per op.** Callers import the plain Python entry point, never a
  `tilelang_*` or `*_kernels` module. Device kernels and `autograd.Function` classes are
  implementation detail.
- **Parallelism-agnostic.** A kernel sees `[local heads x local-or-gathered sequence]`. No
  Megatron import, no process group. TP/SP/CP live in the wrapper module that calls the kernel
  (`miles_plugins/models/`), which does TP through Column/RowParallel projections, SP through
  gather/scatter at the kernel boundary, and CP through an all-gather of KV or a `cp_context`.
- **Variants are parameters, not copies.** An optional feature (RoPE tail, attention sink) is a
  compile-time kernel parameter, so the specialised code paths cost nothing at runtime. Layouts
  are adapters around a packed kernel, never a second kernel: `indexer_logits_sbhd` runs the
  packed indexer once per batch element, and `sparse_attention` takes a batch dimension that
  packed callers set to 1.
- **A new or changed kernel comes with a single-GPU test against a torch reference**, under
  `tests/fast-gpu/kernels/<op>/`.

## Adding support for a new model

Ask first whether the model's ops already exist here.

- Another GDN / KDA model: nothing changes in this package. Point the model's layer spec at
  the shared delta-rule attention module.
- A DSA variant with a new layout or feature: add a parameter branch in `attention/dsa`, do
  not copy the kernel pair.
- A genuinely new op: add `miles/kernels/<op>/` with one entry function and a torch-reference
  test under `tests/fast-gpu/kernels/<op>/`. The model plugin imports the entry function only.
