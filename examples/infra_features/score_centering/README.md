# Score Centering

Correct off-policy score drift using the sampler's top-k probabilities, with optional truncated or masked importance weights.

This implements [Score Centering Stabilizes Off-policy Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.20807), including the efficient top-k approximation in Appendix A.

## Enable it

Add these arguments to an existing text-only GRPO training recipe:

```bash
--loss-type score_centering \
--advantage-estimator grpo \
--score-centering-top-k 128 \
--score-centering-is none \
--rollout-temperature 1.0 \
--rollout-top-p 1.0 \
--rollout-top-k -1 \
--use-rollout-logprobs \
--disable-grpo-std-normalization \
--calculate-per-token-loss
```

For session-server rollouts using more than 20 candidates, also set `--use-miles-router`.

Keep reward mean subtraction enabled. Disabling standard-deviation normalization gives the paper's group-centered rewards. This is a separate REINFORCE-style loss: PPO clipping parameters do not apply. Existing batch size and update scheduling still control how many updates consume a rollout batch; choose them explicitly when reproducing an experiment.

Choose `--score-centering-is tis` for weights clipped at `--score-centering-tis-clip` (default 2). Choose `mis` to retain ratios in `[--score-centering-mis-low, --score-centering-mis-high]` (defaults 0.5 and 5), setting other weights to zero. These weights are centered together with the score. Use these options instead of `--use-tis` or a custom TIS function.

The existing entropy and reference-KL loss options remain available. They are separate regularizers; the score-centering identity applies to the policy-gradient term.
With filtered sampling, sampling-support replay rules prohibit reference KL; entropy is computed over the recorded support.

Training logs include `train/train_rollout_logprob_abs_diff` and `train/train_rollout_kl`. The latter uses the same masked, sampled-token k3 estimator of KL(rollout || train) as the policy loss. It is a detached diagnostic and is emitted even when reference-KL regularization is disabled.

## How it works

When the rollout distribution differs from the current trainer, even a constant reward can produce an unwanted average policy update. Score centering subtracts the expected weighted score under the rollout distribution.

Let `p` be the current trainer distribution, `q` the distribution that actually sampled the token, `H` the stored candidates, `A` the detached advantage, and `f` the selected importance-weight function. The implementation computes:

```text
rho   = max(1 - sum(q[H]), 1e-6) / max(1 - sum(p[H]), 1e-6)
alpha = rho * f(1 / rho)
loss  = -A * (stop_gradient(f(p[token] / q[token])) * log(p[token])
             - sum(stop_gradient(q[H] * f(p[H] / q[H]) - alpha * p[H]) * log(p[H])))
```

Outside `H`, the approximation models `q` as `rho * p`. The sampled token always uses its recorded `q[token]`, including when it is outside `H`. All weights and correction coefficients are detached. Full-distribution centering cancels the expected constant-reward gradient; the top-k version approximates the true tail and does not guarantee exact cancellation for an arbitrary tail.

With top-p/top-k filtering, Miles asks SGLang for log probabilities over the realized sampling support (`sampling_logprobs_mode="support"`). The candidate count must cover that entire support. These are the sampler's post-filter probabilities; Miles stores them directly, while trainer logprobs use the same support. There is then no approximated tail: the correction sums over every token the sampler could emit.

The trainer computes only the requested log probabilities from each vocabulary shard, reducing normalization scalars and selected logits across tensor-parallel ranks. It excludes padded vocabulary entries and computes probabilities in float32 for BF16/FP16 models. `--log-probs-chunk-size` controls the temporary computation size; `--recompute-loss-function` can trade computation for saved activations. No full vocabulary is gathered across ranks.

## Rollout and data contract

Native SGLang generation, the legacy rollout path, and both session-server versions request candidate probabilities at generation time. Each `Sample` carries:

- `rollout_topk_token_ids`: int32 array shaped `[response_length, k]`.
- `rollout_topk_log_probs`: float32 array of the same shape.
- `rollout_log_probs`: the actual sampled-token log probabilities.

For bounded sampling, the candidate arrays contain exactly the surviving tokens and their post-filter logprobs, with unused slots padded. Miles rejects incomplete support coverage or a disagreement with the sampled-token probability.

Evaluation requests skip this collection and may use independent sampling settings, including greedy decoding. The built-in agentic producer marks evaluation sessions when creating them; custom session clients should create them with `POST /sessions` with JSON body `{"evaluation": true}`.

For unfiltered session rollouts, more than 20 candidates require `--use-miles-router`. The SGLang Rust router caps OpenAI `top_logprobs` at 20, while MilesRouter forwards a larger request to SGLang unchanged. To use the SGLang router for unfiltered session rollouts, set `--score-centering-top-k 20` or less. Filtered rollouts request support probabilities instead of `top_logprobs` and do not use that cap. Native `/generate` rollouts support either router.

Unused candidate slots and non-trained observation rows contain token ID `-1` and log probability `-inf`. Tool-observation masks, multi-turn merging, retries, trailing-token trimming, and truncation preserve row alignment. Session serialization and data-parallel sharding retain both arrays. Candidates stay on CPU until the trainer selects its context-parallel rows.

Custom rollout producers must supply these fields with probabilities from the actual generation call. Missing candidates, duplicates, malformed padding, or disagreeing sampled/candidate probabilities fail validation. Rescoring old rollouts with newer weights is not a substitute. With the feature disabled, requests and the session wire format remain unchanged.

## Supported configurations and limits

- The shared loss is wired into Megatron and FSDP. Candidate selection supports tensor parallelism, packed (`thd`) and padded (`bshd`) zigzag context parallelism, and packed all-gather context parallelism.
- Sampling requires a fixed positive temperature and `min_p=0` on every call. Unfiltered sampling uses `top_p=1`, `top_k=-1`. Filtered sampling requires positive `top_k` no larger than `--score-centering-top-k`; top-p filtering also requires positive top-k. For example, use `--rollout-top-p 0.9 --rollout-top-k 64 --score-centering-top-k 128`. See the sampling-support replay guide for its request and server requirements.
- Filtered sampling requires SGLang with support log probabilities (SGLang PR [#40932](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/40932), included in the `sglang-miles` branch by [#41047](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/41047)). The response must include aligned `output_token_sampling_mask` and list-valued `output_token_sampling_logprobs`. Unfiltered sampling still requires `output_top_logprobs`. Miles-managed rollout workers set `SGLANG_RETURN_ORIGINAL_LOGPROB=0`; external servers must use the same setting. OpenAI session responses must expose these fields in `choices[0].meta_info`; a generic OpenAI-compatible server without that metadata is insufficient.
- Constrained/custom sampling, speculative decoding, true-on-policy mode, OPD, multi-LoRA/Tinker losses, sequence masking, custom policy-loss reducers, and logprob recomputation via prefill are rejected. Multimodal token expansion is not supported. The initial advantage estimator is GRPO.
- Retaining `k=128` uses about 1 KiB per response position for the two arrays, before transport overhead. Larger `k` improves the tail approximation at additional storage and compute cost.

## Metrics and verification

Training logs include `sc_correction`, `sc_train_head_mass`, `sc_rollout_head_mass`, `sc_tail_ratio`, `sc_importance_weight`, `train_rollout_kl`, and `train_rollout_logprob_abs_diff`, under the usual `train/` namespace. Small head mass means more of the distribution is approximated by the tail model. Large tail ratios indicate a substantial mismatch in remaining mass.
For filtered sampling, the head covers the full support, so both head masses and the tail ratio should be approximately one.

The numerical tests compare gradients against an independent dense-distribution oracle for all three weighting modes, including sampled tokens outside the head, constant rewards, and tiny tails. Pipeline tests exercise real native/session producers, serialization, data-parallel splitting, masks, advantage computation, regularization, and checkpointed loss scaling. Run the focused tests in the repository's test environment:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/fast/backends/training_utils/test_score_centering.py \
    tests/fast/backends/training_utils/test_score_centering_pipeline.py \
    tests/fast/backends/training_utils/test_score_centering_filtered.py
python -m pytest \
    tests/fast/backends/training_utils/test_score_centering_distributed.py
MILES_TEST_CUDA_DISTRIBUTED=1 python -m pytest \
    tests/fast/backends/training_utils/test_score_centering_distributed.py
```

The distributed tests use four CPU/Gloo processes or four CUDA/NCCL processes (TP=2, CP=2), all three context layouts and weighting modes, plus BF16 selected-probability gradients. The independent dense-gradient oracle also runs on CUDA when available. These are correctness tests, not a reproduction of the paper's GPU training results.

For a real SGLang server, also run the opt-in protocol probe:

```bash
MILES_LIVE_SCORE_CENTERING_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:30000 \
MILES_LIVE_SCORE_CENTERING_MODEL=/path/to/model \
MILES_LIVE_SCORE_CENTERING_SERVED_MODEL=your-served-model \
python -m pytest --confcutdir=tests/manual tests/manual/test_score_centering_live.py
```

Set `SGLANG_RETURN_ORIGINAL_LOGPROB=0` on the server before starting it. The probe checks native and OpenAI response metadata using the production candidate collector and validator, and checks temperature scaling at 0.7, 1.0 and 1.3. It warms the shared prompt first so that cached and uncached prefills do not confound the temperature comparison. Set `MILES_LIVE_SCORE_CENTERING_ARTIFACT_DIR` to keep the raw responses.
